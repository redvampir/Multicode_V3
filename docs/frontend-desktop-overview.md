# Frontend vs Desktop

This document outlines differences between the archived web frontend and the current desktop application.

## Restored Features
- Added **Go to Line** command and modal inspired by the archived frontend. It allows jumping to a specific line number from the command palette.

## Missing Functions
See [frontend-desktop-missing-functions.md](frontend-desktop-missing-functions.md) for a full list of exported functions present in the archived frontend but not in the desktop codebase.
